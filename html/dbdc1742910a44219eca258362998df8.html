<h2>Scan Line Polygon Fill Algorithm</h2>
<p></p>
<h4>Pseudo Code of the algorithm</h4>
<p>Input : Vertices of the polygon, (x<sub>i</sub>, y<sub>i</sub>) &forall;i = {1, 2, ..., n}, n = #vertices in the polygon. We have the following data structures to maintain data:</p>
<ul>
<li><u>Edge Table</u> (ET) : Contains all the edges (except horizontal edges) of the polygon sorted by their smaller y-coordinates. All the edges having equal smaller y-coordinates are kept in the same bucket, where they are sorted by the corresponding x-coordinate.<br /> In each cell, the following information is maintained:<ol type="i">
<li>y_upper : last scanline to consider for this edge</li>
<li>x_lower : corresponding x coordinate for the smaller value y value of the edge</li>
<li>1/m : to compute the corresponding x coordinate of the edge for each scanline</li>
</ol></li>
<li><u>Active Edge Table</u> (AET) : Contains the edges that intersect with the current scan line. For each scan line, the edges are sorted in an increasing order of the x coordinate of the point of intersection.<br /> In each cell, the following information is maintained:<ol type="i">
<li>y_upper : last scanline to consider for this edge</li>
<li>x_lower : x coordinate value of the edge for the present scan line</li>
<li>1/m : to compute the corresponding x coordinate of the edge for each scanline</li>
</ol></li>
</ul>
<p></p>

<legend><u>Steps of the Algorithm</u></legend><ol>
<li>AET is initially empty.</li>
<li>scan_value = Value of y-coordinate for the first nonempty bucket. This is the first scan line from where filling will start.</li>
<li>Do
<ul>
<ul>
<li>From ET[scan_value] bucket, all entries are inserted in AET which satisfy the condition : y<sub>min</sub> = scan_value. This is to include the new edges which have their smaller y value equal to the present scan line.</li>
<li>From AET, remove the entries which satisfy the condition, y<sub>max</sub> = scan_value, i.e., remove the edges not intersecting with the next scanline</li>
<li>Please note that there will be one entry for edges in Fig. 1 and two entries for edges in Fig. 2<br />

<ul>
<li>Sort all the entries in AET w.r.t. the x-coordinate of the intersection point of the edge with the present scan line.</li>
<li>Fill the pixels in the present scanline from x-values mentioned in the odd entries of AET to the x-values mentioned in the next even entry of AET.<br />
	If there are n entries in AET (n will always even), then the following pixels will be filled :<br />
<ul>
<li>1<sup>st</sup> entry to 2<sup>nd</sup> entry</li>
<li>3<sup>rd</sup> entry to 4<sup>th</sup> entry</li>
<li> ... </li>
<li>(n-1)<sup>th</sup> entry to n<sup>th</sup> entry</li>

	</ul>

	</li>
<li>Increment y by 1 (to the coordinate of the next scanline).</li>
<li>For each nonvertical edge remaining in the AET, update x for the new y.</li>

</ul>

Until AET and ET are non empty</li>
