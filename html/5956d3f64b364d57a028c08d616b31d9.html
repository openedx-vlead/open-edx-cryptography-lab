<p>Scaling multiplies the distances from the co-ordinate axes by a constant factor. The scaling matrix which scales by v<sub>x</sub>, v<sub>y</sub> and v<sub>z</sub> units looks like:</p>

<p>On multiplication with a vector, the expected result is obtained:</p>

<p>A scaling transformation can also be interpreted as resizing the co-ordinate axes while keeping the points constant. Thus, a scaling by (2,3) will require redrawing each unit on the X-axis as 2 units and each unit on the Y-axis as 3.</p>
