<p>Rotation transformation rotates points about an axis through the origin. Rotation about the co-ordinate axes X, Y and Z is a standard operation, which is used often in graphics applications.</p>
<p>Rotation is performed by multiplying the point with a Rotation Matrix. There are specific matrices for rotations about X, Y and Z axes.</p>

<p>Rotations can also be performed about an arbitrary axis. This can be done in the following manner:</p>
<ol start="1" type="1">
<li>Rotate the arbitrary axis about one of the co-ordinate axes, say Y, to align it to one of the co-ordinate planes, say XY.</li>
<li>Rotate this axis about the Z axis to align it to the Y axis.</li>
<li>Perform the required rotation about the Y axis using RY.</li>
<li>Reverse the steps 2 and 1 to put the axis back in its original alignment.</li>
</ol>
<p>Rotation matrices rotate all points about an axis passing through the origin. In order to rotate about a particular point, the point must be translated to origin first. Once the rotation is performed, the point must be translated back to its original location. <br /> Thus the matrix for rotating about a particular point is: <br /> M = T<sup>-1</sup>RT <br /> where T translates the point to origin and R is the rotation matrix.</p>
<p>It is important to know the frame of reference when considering rotations, as all rotations are described relative to a particular frame of reference. In general for any orthogonal transformation on a body in a coordinate system there is an inverse transformation which if applied to the frame of reference results in the body being at the same coordinates. For example in two dimensions rotating a body clockwise about a point keeping the axes fixed is equivalent to rotating the axes counterclockwise about the same point while the body is kept fixed. Thus, a rotation of 45&deg; about Z-axis is equivalent to rotating the coordinate system by -45&deg; about the Z-axis.</p>
