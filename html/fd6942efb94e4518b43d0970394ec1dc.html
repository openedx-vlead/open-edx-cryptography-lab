<h2>Sutherland Hodgeman's Polygon Clipping Algorithm</h2>
<h4>Pseudo Code of the algorithm</h4>
<p>Input : Vertices of the polygon, (x<sub>i</sub>, y<sub>i</sub>) &forall;i = {1, 2, ..., n} for n vertices in the polygon and the coordinates of the opposite corners of the clipped window.<br /> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Steps of the Algorithm</span></p>
<pre>for each of the four boundaries of the clipped window
    for each edge e<sub>i</sub>in the polygon<br />        P<sub>i</sub> = (x<sub>i</sub>, y<sub>i</sub>) &amp; P<sub>i+1</sub> = (x<sub>i+1</sub>, y<sub>i+1</sub>) represent the two vertices of edge ei.<br />             if P<sub>i</sub> &amp; P<sub>i+1</sub> both lie outside the clipping area<br />                     then no point is written<br />             else if P<sub>i</sub> &amp; P<sub>i+1</sub> both lie inside the clipping area<br />                     then P<sub>i</sub> is written into the points of clipped polygon<br />             else if P<sub>i</sub> is inside and P<sub>i+1</sub> is outside<br />                     then P<sub>i</sub> is written into the points of clipped polygon and we calculate the intersection of e<sub>i</sub> with the concerned boundary and the point of intersection is written into the points of clipped polygon.<br />             else<br />                     then P<sub>i+1</sub> is written into the points of clipped polygon and we calculate the intersection of e<sub>i</sub> with the concerned boundary and the point of intersection is written into the points of clipped polygon.<br />
