<p><b>STEP 1:</b> For the given cipher text in the <b>PART I</b> of the experiment page, the first step is to generate cipher text by clicking on the "Next Cipher Text" button.</p>
<p><b>STEP 2:</b>Calculate frequencies of generated cipher text by clicking on "Calculate Frequencies in Cipher text" button</p>
<p><b>STEP 3:</b>Copy the generated cipher text from <b>PART I</b> and paste in "Scratch pad" area of <b>PART II</b></p>
<p><b>STEP 4:</b>Analise similarities between "Calculated Frequencies Table" and "English Alphabet Frequencies Table"</p>
<p><b>STEP 5:</b>Based on similarities,try to make a frequency based estimation for each character of cipher text</p>
<p><b>STEP 6:</b>Replace characters of Cipher Text in Scratch pad with a character estimated previously using a <b>Modify</b> function of <b>PART II</b></p>
<p><b>STEP 7:</b>Based on Hints from Cipher text in "Scratch pad" area make more replacement of cipher text characters</p>
<p><b>STEP 8:</b>Repeat <b>Step 7</b> till you get a meaningful English Text</p>
<p><b>STEP 9:</b> Finally, observe the deciphered plain text in Scratch pad Area,if a meaningful English text is formed cut-and-paste it in the text-field named "Solution Plain text" of <b>PART III</b>. Also enter the final character mapping in the"Solution Key" in <b>PART III</b> and click on "Check Answer" button.</p>
<p><b>STEP 10[OPTIONAL]:</b> Verify that your answer is correct, by encrypting the solution plain text with your key in <b>PART IV</b>.</p>
