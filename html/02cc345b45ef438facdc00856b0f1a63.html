<li>The experiment contains a clipping window which represents the screen to which the graphics primitives (polygon in this case) are clipped to.</li>
<li>The experiment allows the user to change the size of the clipping window.</li>
<li>The experiment allows the user to choose the vertices of the polygon. In this experiment we can fill different kinds of polygon like convex and concave polygons in the rectangular (convex) clipping windows.</li>
<li>At each step of the algorithm, the important computations that took place in that step are also given for better understanding of the algorithm.</li>
