<p>Welcome to the Computer Graphics lab ! Here , we will try some virtual experiments to understand the different concepts of graphics. We will go through understanding the concepts of 3D Coordinate systems, Transformations, Hierarchical modelling and Cameras. Later we will be visualising some basic algorithms used to render the graphics.</p>
