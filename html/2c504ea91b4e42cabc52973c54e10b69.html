<p>This experiment introduces the concept of the rotation transformation.</p>
<p>The point has a rotation applied to it. Move the slider at the bottom to watch the rotation of the point about origin.</p>
<p>The tree has a node for the transformation applied to the point. This node shows the rotation axis and the angle by which the point is rotated. As the slider is moved, the transformation animates between the starting and ending points.</p>
<p>The <i>rotation matrix <b>R</b></i>, being applied to the point is also shown. Edit the rotation parameters and notice how this matrix gets changed.</p>
<p>Switch between the two interpretations of rotation at any time by checking the <i>Transform co-ordinate systems</i> checkbox under the <i>Display</i> tab. Use it to compare how the rotation works in both cases. viz., rotation of point with respect to the coordinate axes and the rotation of the coordinate axes wrt the point.</p>
<p>While rotating along some axes, you may require to switch to a 3 dimensional world. This can be done by checking the <i>3D</i> checkbox under the <i>Display</i> tab. Drag with the right mouse button to rotate the world.</p>
