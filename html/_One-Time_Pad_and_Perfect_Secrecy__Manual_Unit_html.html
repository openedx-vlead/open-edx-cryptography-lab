<p>STEP 1: Select a plain text and a key by clicking on the Next buttons next to the respective fields.<br /><br /> STEP 2: If the generated key is biased, make it unbiased in 0 and 1, and use it. You can use the idea given in theory part.<br /><br /> STEP 3: On clicking on "Encrypt" button, you will get the cipher text for the same encryption scheme. You can get the cipher text for as many plain text and key pairs as you like for the same encryption scheme. You can change the encryption scheme too if you want.<br /><br /> STEP 4: You can take a look at all the possible 2^(length of plain text + length of key) tuples of plain text, key and cipher text in the next block.<br /><br /> STEP 5: By observing the tuples obtained above, you need to tell if the encryption scheme being used is secure or not. If not, you need to find the message, m and cipher text, c such that P(M=m|C=c) = P(M=m). In the experiment the size of the message space and that of the key space are equal. Thus from Shannon's theorem, to show that a scheme is not perfect, it is enough if you locate two distinct plain texts that are encrypted to obtain the same cipher text for the same key&nbsp;</p>
