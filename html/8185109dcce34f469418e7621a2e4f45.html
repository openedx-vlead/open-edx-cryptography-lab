<li>The experiment contains a frame buffer which represents the screen to which the graphics primitives (line in this case) are rendered to.</li>
<li>The experiment allows the user to change the size of the frame buffer.</li>
<li>The experiment allows the user to choose the starting and ending coordinates of his own choice.</li>
<li>The user can move forward and backward through the steps of the experiment.</li>
<li>At each step of the algorithm, the important computations that took place in that step are also given for better understanding of the algorithm.</li>
