<p>This experiment introduces the concept of the translation transformation.</p>
<p>The point has a translation applied to it. Move the slider at the bottom to watch the point move to its new location.</p>
<p>The tree has a node for the transformation applied to the point. This node shows the translation distances along each axis. As the slider is moved, the transformation animates between the starting and ending points.</p>
<p>The <i>translation matrix <b>T</b></i>, being applied to the point is also shown. Edit the translation distances and notice how this matrix gets changed.</p>
<p>Transformations can also be interpreted as a modification of the co-ordinate system, while keeping the point in its original place. You can switch to this behavior at any time by checking the <i>Transform co-ordinate systems</i> checkbox under the <i>Display</i> tab. Use it to compare how the transformation works in both cases.</p>
