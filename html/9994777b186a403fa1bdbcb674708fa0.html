<li>Fix the clipping window (the default parameters are already filled in the input boxes) and then click on <b>Enter</b>.<br /> You can also proceed directly to the experiment using the default parameters of the clipping window and the vertices of a polygon, by clicking on <b>Start Experiment with Default Values</b>.</li>
<li>Enter the vertices of the polygon in the input box.<br /> Let, (x<sub>1</sub>, y<sub>1</sub>), (x<sub>2</sub>, y<sub>2</sub>), (x<sub>3</sub>, y<sub>3</sub>), (x<sub>4</sub>, y<sub>4</sub>), (x<sub>5</sub>, y<sub>5</sub>)<br /> represent the vertices of the polygon in order, i.e., the 1<sup>st</sup> vertex is connected to the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> to the 3<sup>rd</sup> and so on. The last vertex is connected to the 1st to complete the polygon.<br /> The default vertices are already filled in the input boxes. Once you have finalized the coordinates, you can click on <b>Start Experiment</b> to begin with the experiment.<br /> You can also go <b>Back</b> to change the values of the frame buffer.</li>
<li>Throughout the experiment, you can click on <b>Next Iteration</b> to go to the next step of the algorithm.</li>
<li>Once the experiment ends, you can again experiment with a new set of vertices of the polygon.</li>
