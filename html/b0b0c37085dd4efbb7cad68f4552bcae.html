<p>"In geometry and linear algebra, a rotation is a transformation in a plane or in space that describes the motion of a rigid body around a fixed point. A rotation is different from a translation, which has no fixed points. A rotation and the above-mentioned transformations are isometries; they leave the distance between any two points unchanged after the transformation." <sub>Courtesy Wikipedia</sub></p>
