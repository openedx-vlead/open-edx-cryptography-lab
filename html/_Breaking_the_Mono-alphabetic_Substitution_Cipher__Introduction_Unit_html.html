<p>We are able to break the shift cipher because of it's small key space. In general, we learned that the large key space is necessary for secrecy. However, we will now see that <span style="font-style: italic;">large key space is not always sufficient </span>either.</p>

<h3>About the experiment:</h3>
<p>In this experiment, we work with another well-known historical encryption scheme, namely the mono-alphabetic substitution cipher, that has a very large key space. However, it is quite easily broken using "Frequency analysis" methods. Your task is to break this cipher. Specifically, given (only) the cipher text in some instance of a mono alphabetic substitution cipher, you need to find the plain text and the secret key.</p>
